# shell-script

This repository contains a collection of Bash shell scripts designed to automate common system administration and utility tasks on Linux systems. The scripts focus on reliability, simplicity, and error handling, making them suitable for personal use or integration into larger automation workflows. All scripts are authored by Harsh Dev Jha and include features such as logging, timestamping, and user-friendly error messages.

# Instructions for Running the Scripts
# Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have Bash installed on your Linux system (most distributions include it by default).
2. Make the scripts executable by running chmod +x <script_name>.sh for each script.
3. Ensure you have appropriate permissions to read/write to the directories used by the scripts (e.g., /home/harsh/backup, /home/harsh/monitoring_logs, /home/harsh/downloads).
4. For the download script, wget must be installed (sudo apt install wget on Debian-based systems).
# General Usage
1. Run scripts from the command line in a terminal.
2. Provide required arguments as specified in each script's section.
3. Scripts will output status messages to the console and may create log files.
